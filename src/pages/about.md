The word "Drewkarnia" is a portmanteau formed by combining my name (Drew) with
the Polish word for a printing press, "drukarnia". I've rendered "Drewkarnia"
above using an experimental font designed in the 1930's by the remarkable Polish
artist Władysław Strzemiński. The symbol for this site is "DK" rendered using
that font: <img src="/DK.png" align="center" style="height:25px" alt="logo"/>.

## Who am I?

I'm an unapologetic globalist, a computer security researcher, a nerd herder, an
amateur economist, an aspiring polyglot, and an owner of a beautiful hand-made
[Gutmeier classical guitar](http://www.gutmeierguitars.com/) (who hopes someday
to play [Aleksander Tansman's
Cavatina](https://www.scribd.com/document/54174038/Alexandre-Tansman-Cavatina)
from beginning to end).

I live in Washington, DC. I have recently started serious study to improve my
Polish language skills in the hopes of finally impressing my Polish-born wife.
One of the reasons I started this site was to share some of my experiences
grappling with this difficult language.

My academic background is in Computer Science. I went to [Carnegie
Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu), and the trajectory of my professional life began
in Pittsburgh. I work as a researcher-cum-manager in my role at
[CERT](https://www.cert.org/), the computer security division of the [Software
Engineering Institute](https://www.sei.cmu.edu), a lab operated by Carnegie
Mellon. My research interest is in experimental design for technology evaluation
in computer security.

My wife and I travel quite a bit, and we both love learning about the history,
culture, foodways and language of new places. I really enjoy learning about how
languages work. I’m especially interested in areas of linguistics that touch on
pragmatics
(<https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics>).
I also play classical guitar, and have a quasi-scholarly interest in early 20th
century music that draws on different folk traditions.
