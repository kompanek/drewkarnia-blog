I've recently learned about discussions in Poland around the most appropriate word
and grammatical gender to use when referring to a woman by her job title. Turns
out, Polish speakers have historically used masculine forms of nouns to refer to
members of a profession of both sexes, rather than using an explicitly feminine
(in the grammatical sense) version of the same noun, but in the 20th century
that started changing, reflecting the reality of more women in professions, and
signaling a sort grammatical gender parity. I haven’t seen much comment on this
English, so I figured I’d write about it. I’ve always found this sort of thing
interesting, and language change is on my mind after having read John
McWhorter’s [Words on the
Move](https://www.amazon.com/Words-Move-English-Still-Literally/dp/1627794719/).
In fact, this is in the spirit of many of the topics McWhorter covers on on the
[Lexicon Valley
Podcast](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley.html) (a favorite
of mine).

Consider a female medical specialist like a cardiologist. She might choose to
refer to herself as a kardiolog (a masculine noun in Polish) or use the new
coinage kardiolożka (a feminine noun) on her resume. Similarly, when you address
her, she may prefer you use a masculine noun as part of the honorific
construction, _Pani doktor_, or the feminine noun, _Pani doktorka_. An academic,
say a female sociologist, faces the same dilemma: she needs to choose between
_socjolog_ and the less common _socjolożka_. Women in business and politics
(think director, manager, president, prime minister) also have a decision to
make. In the public sphere, businesses, newspapers and government offices must
decide how to refer to women in these positions, and those decisions have
cultural and political implications.

As part of an interview 2015, Professor Jan Miodek, a Polish linguist, language
maven, and a sort of unofficial authority on proper language, touched on the
issue in an [article on
dzennik.pl](http://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/opinie/artykuly/501342,jezykoznawca-prof-jan-miodek-korporacje-i-korpomowa-gwalca-jezyk-polski-rozmowa-dziennik-pl.html):

> In the 1970’s, we [started using feminine versions of nouns]: _dyrektorka_
> (business director), _tłumaczka_ (translator), _reżyserka_ (movie director),
> and _reporterka_ (reporter). Then came [the usage of the feminine honorific
> followed by a masculine noun]: _dyrektor_, _reżyser_, _tłumacz_ (translator),
> and _reporter_. In the case of these senior roles in business, the masculine
> form somehow conveys a more serious impression.

On the other hand, he goes on to say that for title of _minister_ (as in
“minister of defense"), the masculine form feels unnatural to him, and that
_ministerka_ (feminine) sounds more natural. He notes that using _ministerka_ is
consistent with trends in other languages: the Czech noun _ministryně_
(feminine, from _ministr_) is in common usage, as is the German feminine noun
for chancellor _Kanzlerin_ (from _Kanzler_).

## Who gets to decide?

Of course, there’s no objectively “right” answer to usage questions like these.
They reflect the feelings of members of a language community, and the particular
trajectory the language and the culture have taken. Questions of usage touch on
feelings about identity, and depend on both the historical baggage carried by
words, and the structure of the language itself. <!--Professor Modiek's opinion
seems to be consistent with the feeling’s expressed by many professional women,
but there will on doubt remain ambiguity and inconsistency in usage, as the
standards are worked out.--> Something like consensus may eventually emerge, but
in the meantime the best thing we can do is let people decide for themselves how
they want to be referred to, and advocate for that.

In [another
article](http://www.gazetawroclawska.pl/artykul/311691,jan-miodek-socjolozka-czy-pani-socjolog,id,t.html),
Miodek references the large variation in forms still in play, citing the choices
made in just one article in Gazeta Wyborcza, a major Polish language newspaper.
The list of nouns included: _psycholog kliniczny_ (clinical psychologist,
masculine), _wiceprezes_ (vice president, masculine), _publicystka_ (publicist,
feminine version of _publicysta_), _socjolożka_ (sociologist, feminine version
of _sociolog_), _autorka_ (author, feminine version of _autor_), _adiunkt_
(adjunct, masculine), _członkini_ (member, feminine version of _członek_),
_krytyczka literacka_ (literary critic, feminine version of _krytyk_), and
_filozof_ (philosopher, masculine), among others.

I also found an
[interview](http://samorzad.pap.pl/depesze/wiadomosci_centralne/135424/Zenskie-formy--Nie-mozemy-zmuszac-kobiet---dr-hab--Katarzyna-Klosinska-z-UW)
with Katarzyna Kłosińska, another Polish linguist. She was also asked whether
people should be using the feminine forms of nouns for professions, and makes a
point about personal choice:

> Of course, we can do it [use feminine versions of the nouns], but the language
> does not absolve of us responsibility for those choices. If we’re not careful
> they may have the opposite [from the intended] effect. All language processes
> should happen naturally. If in a newspaper we read about “critics” (here, she
> uses the feminine form of _krytyk_, _krytyczka_) or “psychologists” (likewise,
> the feminine _psycholożka_), then over time we become familiar with such
> forms. [To the degree that I] encourage the use of female forms, it’s for
> purely functional reasons. It is easier to say "the physicist" (_fizyk_,
> masculine) fell in love with a chemist (_chemiczka_, feminine)" than "the
> physicist fell in love with a chemist (_chemik_, masculine)", because this
> second version sounds strange, although it is correct linguistically. However,
> there are many women who do not accept female forms, they want to be called
> “president” (_prezydent_, masculine) “lawyer” (_adwokat_, masculine) or
> “doctor” (_doktor_), and this is also natural and understandable.

She goes on to say that she personally wants to be referred to using the
traditional, masculine noun for linguist, _językoznawca_ (a noun, which,
although it ends in “a” and takes ending like a feminine noun is itself
masculine), rather than an explicitly feminine form like _językoznawczyni_.

Despite a lack of consensus, newspapers and government organizations will
naturally want to standardize in the interest of consistency of style, and
respect for changing norms. In fact, I found [a government report from
1995](http://biurose.sejm.gov.pl/teksty_pdf_95/e-48.pdf) that was a summary of
"expert" opinion on the consensus on titles.

## How does feminine noun formation work in Polish?

The grammar and sound system of Polish define a set of alternatives for forming
feminine versions of masculine nouns:

* Simply adding “ka” to the end (by far the most common). For example:
  _doktorka_, _lekarka_ and _ministerka_.

* Adding “ka” after an additional syllable, or a consonant change. For example,
  _krytyczka_ (critic), and _kardiolożka_ (cardiologist).

* Adding a feminine suffix other than "ka". For example, _członkini_ (member) is
  an example of a feminine noun derived from _członek_.

The choice of an alternative is subject to some practical constraints. The
natural feminine version of a noun may already have another meaning. For
example, in Polish, the masculine noun for critic is _krytyk_, which would make
the natural feminine form _krytyka_. Unfortunately, that word is already taken:
it means "criticism". An analogous situation exists with _matematyk_,
mathematician, where _matematyka_ already means "mathematics". The feminine noun
for professor, _profesorka_ is also perceived as unavailable by many speakers,
not because it means something competely different, but because it has a
decidely informal tone.

Alternatively, a particular rule might lead to a word that's difficult to
pronounce, or unnatural for Polish. For example, the word _adiunkt_ would become
_adiunktka_, creating an awkward consonant combination “ktk”, hence the use of
_krytyczka_. Likewise, the ż in the formation the feminine version of
_kardkiolog_ avoids a the consonant cluster “gk”, which is quite difficult to
pronounce without adding a stop in between the two hard consonant sounds, or
changing the sound. In Polish, we see a common pattern of “softening” the “g”
sound to “ż” (similar to the “z” sound in the French word “azure”).

## A few observations about grammatical gender

Polish has three grammatical genders for nouns: masculine, feminine, and third
neuter gender. Every noun has a grammatical gender.  In Polish, you can usally
determine the gender of a word just by looking at its ending in the nominative
form (i.e., the form you’ll find it in a dictionary that’s used when a noun is
the subject of a sentence). For our purposes, it’s enough to know that feminine
nouns usually end in “a”, and it’s normal to use a feminine noun when referring
to a female person. For example, _kobieta_ (woman), _żona_ (wife), _dziewczyna_
(girl), _córka_ (daughter) and _siostra_ (sister) are all feminine, and _mąż_
(husband), _chłopiec_ (boy), _syn_ (son), and _brat_ (brother) are masculine.
Those nouns, like all nouns, take on different endings depending on how they’re
used a sentence.

Every noun, whether it refers to a person, an animal or an inanimate object has
a gender. For reasons mostly lost to history, it so happens that word
_wiewiórka_ (squirrel) is feminine, _stół_ (table) is masculine, and _krzesło_
(chair) is neuter.

The details of the rules aren't important. But what’s critical is that we not to
confuse this idea of grammatical gender with biological sex or any other
cultural notion of a gender. No Polish speaker will tell you that there’s
anything particularly feminine about a lamp, that a table is male, or ever be
confused about the existence of male squirrels. And when a linguist talks about
gender they’re just talking about the pattern of variations in pronunciation and
spelling that are part of speaking Polish grammatically.

## How grammatical gender can influence meaning

While it's true that grammatical gender is a technical concept without reference
to biology, there's still some evidence that the gender of a word can color
perceptions.

In Polish, women’s names almost exclusively end in “a", and speakers will tell
you that names like “Yvonne”, “Heather”, or “Lauren” all sound a bit off because
they end in consonants. It's common for languages to have implicit rules for the
spelling and pronunciation of male and female names, and we all have the
experience of enountering a name that doesn't follow gender rules we're used to
seeing.

Many Polish speakers will tell you that gender influences how they might
anthropomorphize an animal: a _wiewiórka_ (squirrel) feels feminine because of
that “a” ending, and the fact that grammatically speaking it will behave just
like a word like _kobieta_ (woman). Or perhaps, it's the similarity to a female
name that (think _Pani Wiewiórka"_) implies a biological sex. Likewise, because
the word _myszka_ (mouse) is feminine, Polish children may do a double take when
they’re introduced to _Myszka Mickey_ (Mickey Mouse in Polish).

It's worth observing that a neuter noun will never be used to refer to an adult
person. In Polish, unlike some other languages with grammatical gender, neuter
strongly connotes sexlessness, or in the case of words like _dziecko_ (child), a
child who hasn’t yet undergone puberty. This shouldn't be confused with generic,
sexless nouns--the equivalents "human" or "person". In fact, while the word for
human is _człowiek_, a masculine noun, the most common word for person is
_osoba_, which is a feminine.

## Can we relate this to English?

Of course, English doesn’t have grammatical gender, but we do have words for
professions and titles that come in male and female versions. When I thought
about how I might draw an analogy to English, what leapt to mind immediately
were the considerations an English speaker would’ve brought to mind when
thinking about similar questions Americans have asked in the past around
historically “gendered” professions:

* Should it be “flight attendant” for everybody, or should we use “steward” for
  men, and “stewardess" for women? How determinative is the gendered ending
  “-ess” and the baggage it has? Should we say waitor and waitress, or use the
  neutral word "server"?

* Why, at one time, did some English speakers feel a need to say “male nurse”
  explicitly when men started joining the ranks of the nursing profession in
  larger numbers.

I posit that for most English speakers "flight attendant" has a more
professional connotation than stewardess. In that way, it's perceived in a
similar way as _profesor_ and _językoznawca_ by many Polish speakers. However,
for many other titles, Polish speakers are beginning to feel that the feminine
versions are more modern and inclusive.

Polish has a feminine noun for nurse, _pielęgniarka_, and the word, as an in
earlier time in English, specifically refers to a female person in a particular
role as a medical professional. Here, there's a clear parallel to English. It's
not the grammatical gender that's important, but the meaning. The gender is
clearly a consequence of that meaning. Grammatically speaking, like the word
_osoba_, there's no reason that you couldn't use  _pielęgniarka_ to describe
male and female nurses, but because of the history, that won't seem quite right
to some speakers.

## The perils of judging as a non-native speaker

I found myself asking whether the Polish feminine noun endings have accumulated
baggage like the “ess” ending in stewardess: a suggestion of diminutiveness or
less-ness. There's some academic work suggesting how attitudes are embedded in
language like this. When I sat down to write this my intuition was that the
feminine endings did connote diminutiveness.

I'll unpack that a little. Polish has a rich grammar for taking an existing noun
and creating new dear, small or cute versions of that noun. This is done by
appending one more diminuitive suffixes. Diminutive ersions of feminine nouns
often end in that same “ka” that's used to feminize a masculine noun, for
example, _herbatka_ (“a bit of tea”), or _krówka_ (calf, literally a little cow,
from _krowa_, cow). For masculine nouns, we also see the consonant k in the
diminutive suffix “ek”, for example, _chlebek_ (“a small loaf of bread),
_ciasteczko_ (a cookie, literally a little cake, from _ciasto_), and _piesek_ (a
little dog, from _pies_).

When I see Polish words ending in “ka”—diminutive or not—I can’t help seeing
them all as connoting smallness or cuteness, as a sort of surface feature of the
word that points to something deeper about its meaning. That is decidedly not
how a Polish person will see those endings. Most of the time, those endings are
experienced as just part of the syntactic machinery of the language, and just
because the “ka” may be used to express diminutiveness in some context, a
speaker won’t report any sort of misogynistic or patronizing flavor to that
ending when interpreting a familiar word. My experience is not so different from
the reaction of the 12-year old American kid studying German when he or she sees
the word _Ausfahrt_ ("exit") and hears “fart”. I'm still amused when I think
about the first time I saw _pij mleko_ on a billboard (that means "drink milk",
where _pij_, drink, is pronounced like "pee" in English).

## Wrapping up

Despite my status as a Polish language outsider, and the difficulty in
generalizing from quotes and anecdotes from native speakers, I feel comfortable
drawing a few conclusions. First, forces at work within the heads of Polish
speakers that really count are not fundamentally different from those of English
speakers. The question hinges on changing ideas about identity, and evolving
social norms. The language establishes a set of rules governing alternatives
that are in play, but in the end it's the meaning of words that count. Second,
grammatical gender does create more opportunities for dissonances between
historical usages of words and new uses, and colors perceptions in some subtle
ways. In that sense, Polish speakers are going to be harder pressed to find
professional nouns that sound neutral in the same way that "flight attendant"
does. Finally, this is just another example of how language is undergoing
constant change, and in the end the only authority on meaning is the language
community itself. To quote John McWhorter from "Words on the Move":

> One of hardest notions for a human being to shake is that a language is
> something that is, when it is actually something always becoming. They tell
> you a word is a thing, when it’s actually something going on.
